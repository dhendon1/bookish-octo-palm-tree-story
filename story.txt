Once upon a time, there was a dog named Doug. He lived in a home with a nice old lady.

Doug was a happy dog who loved his owner. He'd get treats and scritches and pets from 
the old lady every day! That is, until one day the old lady broke her hip. Suddenly 
Doug became homeless. 

Doug was alone for a few months. That is, until the old lady was healed and returned home.
Doug and the old lady went on long walks together with her newly repaired hip.
Doug lived the remainder of his life happy with the old lady.

The end.
